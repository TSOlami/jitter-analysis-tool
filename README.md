# jitter-analysis-tool
This Python program calculates the average delay and jitter (variation in packet arrival times) based on user input of network delays. The implementation uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for clarity and modularity.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Run the script.
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
3. Input delays.
   Example input: `10 20 15 30 25`

4. The program will display the average delay and jitter.
